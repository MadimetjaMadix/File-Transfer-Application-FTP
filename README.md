## File-Transfer-Application-FTP
-The goal of this project was to create a file transfer application system. The file transfer application
system make use of the networking principles studied e.g. protocols, application and
transport layer, socket programming etc. You can imagine the components of the file transfer
application system that we use in our daily lives e.g. FTP application to have an idea of basic
functions/entities in a file transfer application system, however this project required implementation of
only some of these functions/entities so as to limit the scope.
